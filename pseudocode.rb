# 1 a method that returns the sum of two integers:

# define a method, called 'divider' which prompts the user for an integer. 
# Use 'gets' to store the integer in a variable called 'first_integer'
# repeat this for a second integer.
# multiply the two variables together and store the result in a third variable called 'result'


# def divider 
# 	puts "please enter your first integer:"
# 		first_integer = gets.chomp 
# 	puts "please enter your second integer:"
# 		second_integer = gets.chomp 
# 		result = first_integer.to_i + second_integer.to_i
# 	puts "The result of those two integers added together is #{result}!"
# end

# divider


# 2 a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# define a method called 'string_to_array', with one parameter called 'array_of_strings'
# call .each method on array_of_strings and puts
# end

# array = ["Bob", "Donna", "Clive", "Griffen"]
# super_string = ""

# def string_to_array(array_of_strings)
# 		length.to_i = array_of_strings.length
# 		puts array_of_strings[length]
# 		if length > 0 
# 			length -= 1
# end
# end

# puts string_to_array(array)


# I'M STUCK -I'LL RETURN TO THIS TOMORROW WITH A FRESH BRAIN.

# 3 a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# define a method: 'every_other', which takes one argument
# assign a variable 'array' to an array of integers
# use .each_index method to get a list of index. Store it in new_var
# use if loop with new_var to puts result

# array = [1, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7]
# def every_other(array)
# 	new_var = array.each_index
# 	if new_var.odd? == true
# 		puts new_var
# 	end
# end

# every_other(array)

# I'M STUCK -I'LL RETURN TO THIS TOMORROW WITH A FRESH BRAIN.
