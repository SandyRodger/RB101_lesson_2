# PSEUDOCODE

# My program will ask the user for:
# 1. Loan_amount 
# 2. Annual_percentage_rate 
# 3. Loan_duration

# This will be processed using this formula:

# monthly_payment = loan_amount * (monthly_interest_rate / (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate )**(-loan_duration_months)))

# It will output
# 1. The monthly interest rate 
# 2. Loan_duration_months 
# 3. How much the monthly payment is.
